# BASICpy
a heavily annotated implementation of the BASIC interpreter, implemented in python. based on norvig's [code](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/BASIC.ipynb) and inspired by [two bit history](https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/02/learning-basic.html).

## why was BASIC such a big deal?
the altair 8800 is widely credited for bringing affordable computing to the average person. however, its primary interface was a collection of switches, which made it unwieldy and difficult to operate. 

a BASIC interpreter was far easier to program. moreover, once youve learned the intricacies of BASIC, you were able to program other personal computers like tandy, apple, etc. remember, the 70s were the time before modern operating systems, which meant you could not take portability for granted.
